## Installation Guide

### Pre-Requesties/Dependenices:

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

To run the project locally install:
- [Node.JS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

The project requires the following npm packages:

- Typescript
- Supabase Auth
- TailwindCSS
- Jest
- Playwright

These will be installed automatically.

A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) required to run local host.

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ovadiagal/sudolphin.git

cd sudolphin

npm ci
```

The environment variables for the OpenAI and Supabase secrets also need to be setup.

Modify or create `.env` to with this template:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL={YOUR_SUPABASE_DB_URL}
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY={YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY}
OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_OPENAI_KEY}
```

### Running

With the dependencies and libraries installed, run:

`npm run dev`

to start the Node server locally at `localhost:3000`.

To run white-box end-to-end tests run the npm script:

`npm run test:e2e`

or

`npm run test:e2e:ui` for a gui.

To run black-box unit tests run the npm script:

`npm run test`

or

`npm run test:coverage` to generate a coverage report.

## Troubleshoot

- Error: Supabase authentication failed.
- Solution: Verify that the NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY values in .env are correct.

- Error: OPENAI_API_KEY is missing.
- Solution: Ensure your OpenAI API Key is correctly set in the .env file.

- Error: Cannot connect to localhost:3000.
- Solution: Confirm Node.js is installed and that the development server is running.

- Error: Tests fail unexpectedly.
- Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running npm ci again.
